Enums:
    - Follow near-identical syntax rules as normal objects.
    - Creates an object with the same keys and values when converted from TS to JS.
    - Primary goal is to signal to other engineers that these are all closely realted values.
    - Use whenever we have a small fixed set of values that are all closely related and known at compile time.

Cannot add new properties into enum at the run time.
Everything has to be known at compile time itself.
Simply put, hardcoded property values.

There is no performance tuning here. primary goal is to just signal to other engineers that these are a bunch of related constants.
No Performance tuning whatsoever, Boils down to object. :)
