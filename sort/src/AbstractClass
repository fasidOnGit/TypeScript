Abstract Classes
 - Can't be used to create an object directly. a.k.a Cannot instantiate
 - Only used as a parent class.
 - Can contain real implmentation for some methods.
 - The implemented methods can refer to other methods that don't actually just yet.
 (we still have to provide the names and types for the un-implmeneted methods)
 - Can make child classes promise to implement some other method.
